# SharePoint Path Configuration Summary

## Key Discovery: Real Estate is a Document Library, Not a Folder

Based on your `file_discovery.py` and `run_discovery.py` files, here's the correct SharePoint structure:

### Correct Structure

```
bandrcapital.sharepoint.com
└── sites/BRCapital-Internal
    └── [Multiple Document Libraries/Drives]
        ├── Documents (default library)
        └── Real Estate (separate library) ← This is the key!
            └── Deals (folder)
                ├── 0) Dead Deals
                ├── 1) Initial UW and Review
                ├── 2) Active UW and Review
                ├── 3) Deals Under Contract
                ├── 4) Closed Deals
                └── 5) Realized Deals
                    └── [Deal Name folders]
                        └── UW Model (folder)
                            └── [Deal Name] UW Model vCurrent.xlsb
```

### API Call Sequence

1. **Get Site ID**

   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/bandrcapital.sharepoint.com:/sites/BRCapital-Internal
   ```

2. **List All Document Libraries** (to find Real Estate)

   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{site_id}/drives
   ```

3. **Get Real Estate Library Root**

   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{site_id}/drives/{real_estate_drive_id}/root/children
   ```

4. **Navigate to Specific Folders**
   ```
   GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{site_id}/drives/{drive_id}/items/{folder_id}/children
   ```

### Key Code Changes Made

1. **Added `get_real_estate_drive_id()` method** - Finds the Real Estate library by name
2. **Updated discovery logic** - First finds Real Estate drive, then Deals folder within it
3. **Stores `drive_id` with each file** - Needed for downloading files later
4. **Uses exact deal name from folder** - More accurate than parsing from filename

### Critical Differences from Initial Assumption

| Initial (Incorrect)              | Actual (Correct)                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/drive/root:/Real Estate/Deals` | Real Estate is a separate drive                 |
| Single drive path                | Multiple drives, need to find Real Estate first |
| Parse deal name from filename    | Use actual folder name as deal name             |
| Simple path-based navigation     | ID-based navigation through drives and folders  |

### Benefits of This Approach

- **More robust**: Works regardless of how SharePoint URLs are structured
- **More accurate**: Gets exact deal names from folder structure
- **Handles pagination**: Properly handles large folders with many items
- **Better error handling**: Each step can be validated

### Usage with Updated Code

The three files I created have been updated to use this correct structure:

1. **excel_extraction_system.py** - No changes needed (works with any file source)
2. **excel_extraction_test.py** - No changes needed (works with local files)
3. **sharepoint_excel_integration.py** - Updated to use correct API paths

You can now use these with confidence that they match your working discovery pattern!
